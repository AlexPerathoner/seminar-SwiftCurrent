#  About SwiftUIExampleApp

## Overview
SwiftUIExampleApp is a simple app with 3 main feature areas: Mapping, QR Code scanning, and a Profile.  Each feature has a one time only screen that appeals to users to try out the feature.

The app is designed to give you an idea of what SwiftCurrent can do.  The focus is based on functionality and not presentation to avoid cluttering code with too much UI specific code.

## Areas of Interest
Here is a list of things that are interesting to look at from a SwiftCurrent perspective.  Each file has its own documentation to go into more details.

### ContentView
This starting view shows the creation of the 3 main `WorkflowView`s and how SwiftCurrent can be helpful in a `TabView` setting. 

### [FEATURE]FeatureOnboardingView
Each feature has an onboarding view.  Each one does roughly the same thing.  Look at these to see examples of a One-Time Only screen that can be placed at the start of a feature flow.
