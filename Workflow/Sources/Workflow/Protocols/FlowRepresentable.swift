/**
 A component in a `Workflow`; should be independent of the workflow context.
 
 ### Discussion:
 It's important to make sure your `FlowRepresentable` is not dependent on other `FlowRepresentable`s.
 It's okay to specify that a certain kind of data needs to be passed in and passed out, but keep your `FlowRepresentable` from knowing what came before, or what's likely to come after.
 In that way you'll end up with pieces of a workflow that can be moved or put into multiple places with ease.
 Declare an input type of `Never` when your `FlowRepresentable` does not care about data passed in.
 Declare an output type of `Never` when your `FlowRepresentable` will not pass data forward in the `Workflow`.
