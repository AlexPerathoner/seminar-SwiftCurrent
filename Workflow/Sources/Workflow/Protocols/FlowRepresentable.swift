/**
 A component in a `Workflow`; should be independent of the workflow context.
 
 ### Discussion
 It's important to make sure your `FlowRepresentable` is not dependent on other `FlowRepresentable`s.
 It's okay to specify that a certain kind of data needs to be passed in and passed out, but keep your `FlowRepresentable` from knowing what came before, or what's likely to come after.
 In that way you'll end up with pieces of a workflow that can be moved or put into multiple places with ease.
 Declare an input type of `Never` when the `FlowRepresentable` will ignore data passed in from the `Workflow`.
 An output type of `Never` means data will not be passed forward.

     ### Discussion
     This method is called *after* `init` but *before* any other lifecycle events. It is non-mutating and should not change the `FlowRepresentable`.
     - Note: Returning `false` can have different behaviors depending on the `FlowPersistence`.
