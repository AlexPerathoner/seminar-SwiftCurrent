SwiftCurrent provides `SwiftCurrent_CLI`, a utility that can make decoding workflows much more convenient. Invoke the CLI by using `swift run --product=SwiftCurrent_CLI generate <command>`. If you'd like to have SwiftCurrent create a `FlowRepresentableAggregator` for you, simply run `swift run --product=SwiftCurrent_CLI generate type-registry <path-to-sources> --output=<path-to-save-generated-file>`. 

Add the code generation step to your project *before* you compile sources. Also, make sure to reference the generated file from your project. This tool will read all the `.swift` files in the sources you provided, find every type that conforms to `WorkflowDecodable`, and create a registry that contains all of them. It also provides convenient methods to simplify decoding workflows (you will not have to pass an aggregator because it defaults to the generated one).
